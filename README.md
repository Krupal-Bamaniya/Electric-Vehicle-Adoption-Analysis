# Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project leverages the Electric Vehicle Population Dataset from Kaggle to provide insights into electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends. The dataset includes information on vehicle types, geographical distribution, temporal trends, adoption patterns by model and brand, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility. The dashboard supports decisions related to EV policies, market trends, and regional adoption differences.

## Data Description
The dataset contains:
- **Vehicle Types:** Information on whether a vehicle is a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
- **Geographical Distribution:** Details on the city, county, state, and postal code where each EV is registered.
- **Temporal Trends:** Model year data to analyze when each vehicle was produced.
- **Adoption Patterns:** Insights into vehicle models, brands, and regional trends in EV adoption.
- **CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) Eligibility:** Indicates whether vehicles are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle privileges or Not.

## Analysis & insights
### 1. EV Adoption Trends
- **Vehicle Types (BEV vs. PHEV):** Compare the adoption rates of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) over time, identifying trends in consumer preferences.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze EV registration data by model year to understand how adoption has accelerated and whether it correlates with new technology releases or policy changes.
- **Growth Acceleration:** Track how EV adoption has increased, particularly in the last few years, driven by a shift towards sustainability and clean energy.
### 2. Geographical Distribution
- **Top EV Regions:** Identify cities, counties, and states with the highest concentration of EV registrations, offering insights into regional market penetration.
- **Regional EV Growth:** Explore the growth of EV adoption across different regions, correlating with local incentives, infrastructure development, and policy initiatives.
- **Urban vs. Rural Adoption:** Compare EV adoption rates between urban and rural areas, analyzing how income levels, policies, and regional infrastructure influence EV ownership.
### 3. Adoption Patterns by Model & Brand
- **Top EV Models and Brands:** Identify the top-performing EV models and brands in terms of registrations, both nationally and regionally.
- **Growth Leaders:** Highlight the fastest-growing EV models and brands, focusing on those leading the market and driving adoption.
- **Regional Brand Preferences:** Analyze the performance of different EV brands in various regions to uncover consumer preferences and regional brand dominance.
### 4. Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
- **Eligibility Insights:** Determine the number of EVs eligible for CAFV privileges, such as HOV lane access, tax benefits, and other regional incentives.
- **Geographical Distribution of CAFV Vehicles:** Map the distribution of CAFV-eligible vehicles, highlighting regions where government policies and incentives have significantly boosted EV adoption.
- **Policy Impact on Adoption:** Examine how CAFV eligibility has impacted EV adoption rates, especially in regions with strong incentive programs, and recommend policy changes to further promote EV use.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
- Interactive visualizations for exploring EV adoption trends across vehicle types, model years, and geographical regions.
- Geospatial analysis to highlight EV concentration and growth in specific cities, counties, and states.
- Model and brand analysis to track top EV performers and growth leaders.
- CAFV eligibility breakdown showing how government incentives influence EV adoption and regional differences in policy effectiveness.
